# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Understanding Users (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 1)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.
> You are **required to author 3 of your own questions**.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am re-designing the website for Ithaca's Apple Harvest Festival. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

(These questions assume you are interviewing a festival attendee at the festival. If you didn't attend the festival, you may revise the questions and instead ask the participant to recall the last festival/event they attended. Do not ask them to speculate about visiting the Apple Harvest Festival. User speculation provides biased data.)

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

2. What brought you to visit the Apple Harvest Festival today?

3. Before you came to the festival today, did you seek out any information about the festival before getting here?
3a. If yes, What information were you specifically looking for? Did you find it? How did you access that information?

4. When you arrived at the festival, did you seek out any information about the festival?
4a. If yes, What was that information? How did you obtain it?

5. Now that you're here participating in the festival, have you sought out information about the festival?

6. What, in the past, has been your favorite thing about the festival, and that you would want others to know to do here?
6a. Who would you say the target audience of this activity was?

7. What information were you looking about this festival, or others, that you weren't able to find, if any?
7a. Why did you need this information?

8. Now that you're at the festival, did the website seem to accurately represent the festival? Why or why not?

9.  Any other questions or comments that you didn't have the opportunity to bring up before?
...

n. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

**After the interview:** This was really helpful. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. Have a great day!


### Interview Notes (Milestone 1)
> Interview at least 3 people from your audience. Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.
> **Copy the interview questions above into each interviewee section below.**
> Take notes for each participant inline with the questions.

**Interviewee 1:**

Maddy Demers '25 InfoSci

- Did visit the website to check out what was going on before hand
- Found it was poorly oreinted and difficult to find information
- No enough imagery; no hours listsed
- Usually, expects event listings, food choices, carnival choices, locations, etc.
- Arrived by running, didn't need to use a map to navigate: If going up a hill, then going wrong way
- Excited for apple fest, found it much more fun than website may have alluded


**Interviewee 2:**

Carlton Cassidy '24 CS

- Had a group of friends and wanted to see Apple Fest in the commons, doesn't go much to the commons or downtown
- Visited AppleFest before, has never needed or used website for purposes of visiting
- No particular plans, just wanted to explore; never needed website for such purposes
- Favorite things were the variety of foods available - would like that to be shown on the website so others can see the selection, too.
- Didn't event know the website existed, didn't want to use it when at the festival - just prefers walking around

**Interviewee 3:**

Chukwundamebi Obi '23 Sociology

### Goals (Milestone 1)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Content that prepares a user for AppleFest

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Addition of hours to the website
  - Make list of events easy to find
  - List out vendors and oppurtunities
  -
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The most important aspect of a website is its content, second, its organization. Without good organization, good content is unreachable and therefore useless. Thus, it is important to include content that users desire, such as the aforementioned.

Goal 2: Good Visual Design
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Make sure site is dynamically responsive
  - Use of photos to show essence of event
  - Use of a good palette and simple contrast
  -
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - It is important to design a site that is accessible for all audiences, no matter their device or screen size. Thus, responsive web design is imperative. Moreover, making the site visually appealing and setting a good expectation for the user are important goals.

Goal 3: Organize Content

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - A menu bar that properly delegates content to different pages.
  - A home page that provides the basic information that just about every user is looking for or would find helpful
  - A gallery of photos
  - other pages with more specific information that different users will be looking for and can navigate to easily

- **Rational and Additional Notes**
- It is imperative that the content is organized in such a way that every piece of information can be easily found.

### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. .

Largely, the audience will be Ithacans or local college students interested in AppleFest. The audience will wish to find quick information about applefest such as events, hours, vendors, and see visual representation of the fest, such as photos and/or a map. Thus, they are cohesive geographically and have the same intentions.

## Festival/Event Website Design Exploration (Milestone 1)

Identify three festival or event websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://www.rochesterjazz.com/>

    ![Rochester Jazz  Festival narrow](roc_jazz_fest_narrow.png)

    ![Rochester Jazz Festival wide](roc_jazz_fest_wide.png))

2. <https://rochesterevents.com/lilac-festival/>

    ![Rochester lilac festival narrow](roc-lilac-fest-narrow.png)

4.
    ![Roc Fringe Festival narrow](roc-fringe-fest-narrow.png)
    ![Roc Fringe festival wide](roc-fringe-fest-wide.png)

### Festival/Event Website 1 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

Consisting of primarily jazz concerts, the website emphasis the free offerings of the Rochester Jazz Festival. As such, we see headliners almost immediately, with photos, a calendar of events organized by location. The website also "features" certain highlight events, and has a blog of news & events. The design is a simple Black-White-Red palette, with the colors slightly desaturated, in theme of the Jazz Festival colors. There are also some embedded videos, as well as some statistics. The website is mobile friendly - content is still top-bottom, with some content omitted for brevity.

### Festival/Event Website 2 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

Another free festival offering coming out of Rochester, the Lilac Festival is one of the largest and most unique of its kind. In its 121st year, the festival website does well to implement a simple and navigable design. While the festival is currently out of season, there are still action items, such as learning more about past events, or signing up to volunteer. The website has not been updated, however, to reflect that these events are of the past. A user could become confused that the event listings are for the 2023 year, where they are actually of the past Festival of 2022. The mobile version preserves all content, but makes it top down. Some of it could be omitted.


### Festival/Event Website 3 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

By far the coolest festival Rochester has to offer, the Fringe Festival has been around for over a decade now. The website has been updated to show that the Fringe festival of 2022 has already happened, but to stay tuned for details about the next one. There are few options for the user: go to the gift shop, view the sponsors, or learn more. A user can learn more about past festivals to know what to expect for the 2023 festival. Like the previous websites, the meu bar turns into a hamburger when narrow.

This content ought to fulfill the aforementioned needs of the site audience. We plan these pieces of content and intend to organize them in these groups so they are easily discernable and will cater to the distinct needs of users. Largely, the about and highlighted events should be the most useful, and will thus be at the top. The rest of the information is helpful for perusal, or if users are looking for specifics.
