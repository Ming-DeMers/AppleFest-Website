# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Understanding Users (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 1)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.
> You are **required to author 3 of your own questions**.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am re-designing the website for Ithaca's Apple Harvest Festival. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

(These questions assume you are interviewing a festival attendee at the festival. If you didn't attend the festival, you may revise the questions and instead ask the participant to recall the last festival/event they attended. Do not ask them to speculate about visiting the Apple Harvest Festival. User speculation provides biased data.)

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

2. What brought you to visit the Apple Harvest Festival today?

3. Before you came to the festival today, did you seek out any information about the festival before getting here?
3a. If yes, What information were you specifically looking for? Did you find it? How did you access that information?

4. When you arrived at the festival, did you seek out any information about the festival?
4a. If yes, What was that information? How did you obtain it?

5. Now that you're here participating in the festival, have you sought out information about the festival?

6. What, in the past, has been your favorite thing about the festival, and that you would want others to know to do here?
6a. Who would you say the target audience of this activity was?

7. What information were you looking about this festival, or others, that you weren't able to find, if any?
7a. Why did you need this information?

8. Now that you're at the festival, did the website seem to accurately represent the festival? Why or why not?
   
9.  Any other questions or comments that you didn't have the opportunity to bring up before?
...

n. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

**After the interview:** This was really helpful. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. Have a great day!

## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs about a paragraph. Sketches can often help tell the story of your design.
